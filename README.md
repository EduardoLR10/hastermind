Hastermind, the mastermind game written in Haskell, was created by <a href= https://github.com/EduardoLR10> Eduardo Lemos Rocha</a>, <a href=https://github.com/Nothnbutthefacts>Nothing But the Facts</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/blockthrasher>Justin Cummins, A.K.A Blockthrasher</a>, as the final haskell project for <a href=https://education.emurgo.io/>Emurgo Accademy</a>, and the first <a href=https://www.dapp360.io/>DApp360 Blockchain Developer Workforce</a> Cohort.
It follows typcial <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>Mastermind</a> gamplay. 

<h2>Hastermind Gameplay</h2>

In Hastermind a Master (player) creates a secret code (a series of colors). <br>
The Master can chose how many colors the secret will have and how many rounds the players will be allowed to guess the secred code. 
Players then try to guess the colors (in order) or the secret code. The Master then marks Black for correct collor in correct position, White for correct color in incorrect position and None, for neiter correct color or position. 
If a player guesses all correct colors in the correct positions in the number of alloted rounds they win the game. 
Otherwise, the Master wins.
